# dev2next Conference MCP Demo

This project demonstrates **Integrating LLMs in Java: A Practical Guide to Model Context Protocol** - a presentation 
created for the **dev2next 2025 conference** (September 29 - October 2, 2025) at The Broadmoor, Colorado Springs, CO.

## About This Demo

As Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionize application development, Java developers face a critical challenge: 
how to securely and efficiently connect these AI models with enterprise data and tools. This demo showcases how 
the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** offers a practical solution by providing a standardized approach for integrating 
AI capabilities into Java applications while maintaining enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## What You'll See

Through this working application, you'll explore:

- **Java MCP Server Implementation** using Spring Boot 3.5.6 and Spring AI 1.1.0-M2
- **Conference Data Integration** - Real dev2next 2025 session data accessible via MCP
- **Multiple MCP Components**:
  - **Tools**: Session querying, analytics, and data aggregation
  - **Resources**: Direct access to conference tracks and metadata
  - **Prompts**: Guided AI analysis of conference data
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Repository pattern, dependency injection, and clean architecture
- **Type Safety**: Enum-based session types with Jackson integration

## Conference Integration

This demo uses real **dev2next 2025 conference data** including:
- 28+ sessions across 4 days (Sept 29 - Oct 2, 2025)
- 6 tracks: Architecture, Java, AI, Leadership, Cloud, General
- Multiple session types: Workshops, Keynotes, Talks, General Sessions
- Real speakers, rooms, and scheduling information

## Key Takeaways

Attendees will leave with everything needed to start implementing MCP in their Java projects:
- Working code examples and architectural patterns
- Best practices for secure AI integration
- Patterns for building custom MCP servers
- Practical strategies for enhancing existing applications with AI capabilities

Whether you're new to AI integration or looking to standardize your approach across the enterprise, this demo provides actionable insights to immediately improve your AI development workflow.
