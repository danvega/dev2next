# Integrating LLMs in Java: A Practical Guide to Model Context Protocol

As Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionize application development, Java developers face a critical challenge: how to securely and efficiently connect these AI models with enterprise data and tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a practical solution by providing a standardized approach for integrating AI capabilities into Java applications while maintaining enterprise-grade security and scalability.
Through live coding demonstrations, we'll explore how to leverage Java's MCP implementation to build powerful AI-enabled applications. Starting with basic setup and configuration, we'll progress to building custom MCP servers using Java and create practical features that combine the power of LLMs with Java's robust ecosystem. You'll see firsthand how to connect your Java applications to Claude Desktop and other AI tools while maintaining control over your data and infrastructure.
Attendees will leave this session with everything needed to start implementing MCP in their Java projects: working code examples, best practices for secure AI integration, patterns for building custom MCP servers, and practical strategies for enhancing existing applications with AI capabilities. Whether you're new to AI integration or looking to standardize your approach across the enterprise, you'll gain actionable insights to immediately improve your AI development workflow.
